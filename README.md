# color-replace

color-replace is a replacement library for JavaScript. It replaces all instances of colors in all their forms. Simply pass a `hex` color for example, provide a replacement color (in any format), and it will find all instances of that `hex` color and all other formats (like `rgb`, `hsl` etc.) in a given string.
